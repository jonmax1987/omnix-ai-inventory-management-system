# 🔐 Authentication Request - Backend Team

**Date:** August 17, 2025  
**From:** Frontend Development Team  
**To:** Backend Development Team  
**Subject:** Test User Credentials Needed for Frontend Authentication

---

## 🎯 **Request Summary**

We need **test user credentials** to complete the frontend authentication integration. The backend `/auth/login` endpoint is working correctly, but we need valid credentials to test the full authentication flow.

---

## 🔍 **Current Authentication Status**

### ✅ **What's Working**
- **✅ Login Endpoint:** `POST /v1/auth/login` responds correctly
- **✅ Protected Endpoints:** Return 401 Unauthorized (expected behavior)
- **✅ Frontend Auth Service:** Fully implemented and ready
- **✅ JWT Token Handling:** Automatic token management configured
- **✅ Token Refresh:** Auto-refresh on 401 errors implemented

### ⚠️ **What We Need**
- **Valid test user credentials** to authenticate and test protected endpoints

---

## 📋 **Authentication Test Results**

### 🧪 **Current Test Status**

```bash
# Testing login endpoint
curl -X POST "https://18sz01wxsi.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/v1/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "test@example.com", "password": "testpass"}'

# Response:
HTTP 401 Unauthorized
{"message":"Unauthorized","statusCode":401}
```

**Result:** Login endpoint is working, but we need valid credentials that exist in your user database.

---

## 🔑 **What We Need from Backend Team**

### 1. **Test User Credentials**

Please provide one or more test users with the following format:

```json
{
  "email": "test-user@omnix-ai.com",
  "password": "YourTestPassword123"
}
```

**Requirements:**
- ✅ Email and password that exist in your user database
- ✅ User should have permissions to access all endpoints
- ✅ Credentials should work with your JWT authentication system
- ✅ Can be a dedicated test user (doesn't need to be real data)

### 2. **Expected Login Response Format**

Please confirm the exact response format from `/auth/login`:

```json
{
  "user": {
    "id": "user-uuid",
    "email": "test@omnix-ai.com", 
    "name": "Test User",
    "role": "admin"
  },
  "accessToken": "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9...",
  "refreshToken": "refresh-token-here",
  "expiresIn": 3600
}
```

**Questions:**
- Is this the correct response structure?
- Are the field names exact? (`accessToken` vs `access_token`?)
- Is the user object nested or at root level?

## 🧪 **What We'll Test Once We Have Credentials**

### Step 1: Authentication Test
```bash
curl -X POST "https://18sz01wxsi.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/v1/auth/login" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email": "PROVIDED_EMAIL", "password": "PROVIDED_PASSWORD"}'
```

### Step 2: Protected Endpoint Test
```bash
curl -X GET "https://18sz01wxsi.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/v1/products" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer JWT_TOKEN_FROM_LOGIN"
```

### Step 3: Frontend Login Test
- Navigate to frontend login page
- Enter provided credentials
- Verify successful authentication
- Test dashboard, products, alerts pages

---

## 📊 **Expected Test Results**

Once we have credentials, we should see:

### ✅ **Successful Authentication:**
```json
{
  "data": {
    "token": "valid-jwt-token",
    "user": { /* user data */ }
  }
}
```

### ✅ **Successful API Calls:**
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "id": "product-1",
      "name": "Sample Product",
      "quantity": 100,
      // ... other product fields
    }
  ],
  "pagination": { /* pagination info */ }
}
```

## 🚀 **How to Provide Credentials**

### Option 1: Reply to this message with:
```
Test Email: user@omnix-ai.com
Test Password: TestPassword123!
```

### Option 2: Create a test user in your database:
```sql
-- Example user creation (adjust for your database)
INSERT INTO users (email, password_hash, name, role) 
VALUES (
  'test@omnix-ai.com', 
  'HASHED_PASSWORD', 
  'Test User', 
  'admin'
);
```

### Option 3: Environment variable or config:
If you have existing admin/test accounts, please share the credentials.

## ⏱️ **Timeline**

**URGENT:** We need these credentials to:
- ✅ Complete integration verification
- ✅ Test all frontend features
- ✅ Demonstrate working system
- ✅ Begin user acceptance testing

**Please provide credentials as soon as possible so we can complete the final verification steps.**

---

## 📋 **Additional Questions**

1. **Do you have existing admin/test users in the database?**
2. **Should we create our own test user account?**
3. **Are there any specific user roles/permissions we should test?**
4. **Do different users have different access levels?**

---

## 🎯 **Once We Have Credentials**

We will immediately:
1. ✅ Test authentication flow
2. ✅ Verify all protected endpoints return data
3. ✅ Test complete frontend user workflows
4. ✅ Generate final integration success report
5. ✅ Confirm production readiness
