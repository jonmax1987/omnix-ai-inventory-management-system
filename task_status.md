- Tech: Vite + React + TypeScript, React Router, Zustand, React Query, Axios; tests with RTL + jest-axe
- API: Use `VITE_API_BASE_URL` for `/v1/*` and `/v1/ai/*`; types derived from `api-spec/omnix-api.yaml`
- Deployment: S3 + CloudFront (separate bucket/distribution), CI/CD later
- First Milestone: Scaffold project, base routing, theme with RTL + i18n, API client, stores, smoke tests
