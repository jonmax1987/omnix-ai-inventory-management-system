# Session: 2025-01-19 14:00

## Completed
1. Designed comprehensive AI Customer Analytics System
2. Created detailed system architecture document
3. Established professional development workflow
4. Set up context management structure
5. Initialized documentation framework

## Decisions Made
- **AI Service**: AWS Bedrock with Claude for customer analysis
- **Architecture**: Lambda-based AI processing with DynamoDB storage
- **Data Strategy**: Comprehensive profiling with socioeconomic inference
- **Workflow**: Session-based development with strict context management

## Files Created
- `/AI_CUSTOMER_ANALYTICS_SYSTEM_DESIGN.md` - Complete system specification
- `/DEVELOPMENT_WORKFLOW.md` - Professional workflow guidelines
- `/docs/CURRENT_SPRINT.md` - Active sprint tracking
- `/context/customer-ai/PHASE_STATUS.md` - Phase 2 status
- `/context/customer-ai/NEXT_STEPS.md` - Immediate action items

## Next Session Should
1. Install AWS Bedrock SDK
2. Create BedrockAnalysisService
3. Implement first AI analysis Lambda
4. Test with sample purchase data
5. Review files: 
   - `/backend/src/customers/`
   - `/backend/src/ml/`

## Code Changes
- No code changes yet - planning and architecture phase

## Key Insights
- System will analyze last 20 purchases per customer
- AI will identify consumption patterns (e.g., "buys milk every 5 days")
- Focus on accuracy through multi-layered data validation
- Privacy-first approach with GDPR compliance

## Blockers/Questions
- Need AWS Bedrock access credentials
- Confirm Claude model selection (Sonnet vs Haiku)
- Clarify cost constraints for AI API calls

## Commands for Next Session
```bash
cd backend
npm install @aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime
git checkout -b feature/customer-ai-analytics
```

## Progress Summary
- Phase 1: âœ… Complete (Foundation)
- Phase 2: ðŸš€ Starting (AI Integration)
- Overall: 25% â†’ 30% complete

## Handoff Notes
The system design is complete and comprehensive. Next session should focus on actual implementation starting with AWS Bedrock integration. All context files are prepared for efficient development workflow.
