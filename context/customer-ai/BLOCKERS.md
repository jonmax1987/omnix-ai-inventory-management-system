# Blockers & Questions - Customer AI Analytics

## Current Blockers ðŸš¨

### âœ… No Active Blockers - Phase 3 Complete!

All Phase 3 objectives have been successfully implemented. The system is production-ready with monitoring, cost tracking, caching, and batch processing.

## Resolved Blockers âœ…

### 1. AWS Bedrock Access
**Status**: âœ… RESOLVED
**Impact**: None - Integration completed successfully
**Details**: 
- âœ… AWS Bedrock access enabled in AWS account
- âœ… IAM permissions configured for Lambda to call Bedrock
- âœ… Claude 3 Haiku model access granted and tested

**Resolution**:
- Bedrock IAM policy created and attached to Lambda role
- Direct API test confirmed with "BEDROCK_TEST_SUCCESS"
- Production deployment completed successfully

### 2. Environment Variables
**Status**: âœ… RESOLVED
**Impact**: None - All variables configured
**Details**:
- âœ… `AWS_BEDROCK_REGION=us-east-1` - Configured in Lambda
- âœ… `BEDROCK_MODEL_ID=anthropic.claude-3-haiku-20240307-v1:0` - Set
- âœ… `AI_ANALYSIS_ENABLED=true` - Feature enabled

**Resolution**:
All environment variables updated in Lambda function configuration

## Phase 4 Considerations ðŸ¤”

### Technical Decisions for Phase 4

1. **Customer Segmentation Strategy**
   - Which clustering algorithm? (K-means, DBSCAN, Hierarchical?)
   - How many segments to create?
   - Dynamic vs static segmentation?
   - **Recommendation**: Start with K-means with 5-7 segments

2. **Streaming Architecture**
   - Kinesis Data Streams vs Kinesis Data Firehose?
   - Real-time vs near-real-time processing?
   - Integration with existing batch system?
   - **Recommendation**: Kinesis Data Streams for flexibility

3. **Multi-Region Deployment**
   - Primary region: eu-central-1 (current)
   - Secondary regions for expansion?
   - Data sovereignty requirements?
   - Cross-region replication strategy?

### Implementation Questions

1. **Trigger Strategy**
   - When to trigger AI analysis?
     - Option A: After every purchase
     - Option B: Daily batch for all active customers
     - Option C: On-demand when customer logs in
   - **Recommendation**: Combination of B + C

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Cache duration for AI predictions?
   - Redis or DynamoDB for caching?
   - Cache invalidation rules?

3. **Fallback Behavior**
   - What if Bedrock is unavailable?
   - Fallback to basic recommendations?
   - Error handling and retry logic?

### Business Questions

1. **Privacy & Consent**
   - Explicit consent required for AI analysis?
   - Opt-in vs opt-out model?
   - Data anonymization requirements?

2. **Success Metrics**
   - Primary KPI to optimize for?
   - How to measure prediction accuracy?
   - A/B testing approach?

## Resolved Blockers âœ…

### Phase 1-3 Blockers (All Resolved)
- âœ… Database table creation - Completed
- âœ… API endpoint design - Implemented
- âœ… Basic ML algorithm selection - Content-based filtering chosen
- âœ… Module structure - Clean architecture implemented
- âœ… AWS Bedrock access - Fully operational
- âœ… Cost tracking - DynamoDB and CloudWatch integrated
- âœ… Performance optimization - Caching and batch processing implemented
- âœ… Monitoring - 4 CloudWatch dashboards deployed

## Dependencies

### External Dependencies
- AWS Bedrock service availability
- AWS SDK for JavaScript v3
- DynamoDB capacity for new tables

### Internal Dependencies
- Existing orders service for purchase data
- Products service for product details
- Authentication service for customer identity

## Risk Factors

1. **Bedrock Quotas**: Default quotas might be too low
2. **Cost Overrun**: AI API calls could exceed budget
3. **Latency**: Real-time AI analysis might be slow
4. **Data Quality**: Poor purchase history = poor predictions

## Escalation Path

1. **Technical Issues**: Development team lead
2. **AWS/Infrastructure**: DevOps team
3. **Budget/Cost**: Product manager
4. **Privacy/Legal**: Compliance team
