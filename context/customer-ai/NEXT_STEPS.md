# Next Steps - Customer AI Analytics

## Immediate Tasks (Priority Order)

### ✅ 1. AWS Bedrock Setup - COMPLETED
```bash
# Install AWS SDK with Bedrock
cd backend
npm install @aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime
```

**Files created:**
- ✅ `/backend/src/services/bedrock.service.ts`
- ✅ `/backend/src/interfaces/ai-analysis.interface.ts`

### ✅ 2. Create AI Analysis Service - COMPLETED
**Location**: `/backend/src/customers/ai-analysis.service.ts`

**Key functions implemented:**
- ✅ `analyzeCustomerConsumption()`
- ✅ `analyzeCustomerProfile()`
- ✅ `generateRecommendations()`
- ✅ `predictNextPurchaseDate()`
- ✅ `getReplenishmentAlerts()`

### 3. Enhance Purchase History Service
**File**: `/backend/src/customers/purchase-history.service.ts`

**Add methods:**
- `getEnrichedHistory(customerId, limit)`
- `calculatePurchaseFrequency(purchases)`
- `detectConsumptionPatterns(purchases)`

### ✅ 4. Create API Endpoints - COMPLETED
**File**: `/backend/src/customers/customers.controller.ts`

**New endpoints implemented:**
- ✅ `GET /v1/customers/{id}/ai-analysis`
- ✅ `GET /v1/customers/{id}/consumption-predictions`
- ✅ `GET /v1/customers/{id}/customer-profile-analysis`
- ✅ `GET /v1/customers/{id}/ai-recommendations`
- ✅ `GET /v1/customers/{id}/replenishment-alerts`
- ✅ `GET /v1/customers/{id}/purchase-prediction/{productId}`
- ✅ `POST /v1/customers/{id}/analyze`
- ✅ `GET /v1/customers/{id}/analysis-history`

## Code Snippets to Start With

### Bedrock Service Structure
```typescript
@Injectable()
export class BedrockAnalysisService {
  private bedrock: BedrockRuntimeClient;
  
  constructor() {
    this.bedrock = new BedrockRuntimeClient({
      region: process.env.AWS_REGION || 'us-east-1'
    });
  }
  
  async analyzeShoppingPatterns(purchases: Purchase[]): Promise<AIAnalysis> {
    // Implementation here
  }
}
```

## Testing Data Needed
- Sample customer with 20+ purchases
- Various product categories
- Different time intervals
- Seasonal variations

## Questions to Resolve
1. Bedrock model selection (Claude 3 Sonnet vs Haiku)?
2. Caching strategy for AI results?
3. Batch vs real-time analysis triggers?
4. Cost optimization approach?

## ✅ Session Goal - COMPLETED
Complete AWS Bedrock integration and create first working AI analysis system that can predict when a customer needs to buy milk based on their history.
