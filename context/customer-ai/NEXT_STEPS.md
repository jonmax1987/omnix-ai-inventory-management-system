- ✅ `POST /v1/customers/{id}/analyze`
- ✅ `GET /v1/customers/{id}/analysis-history`

## Code Snippets to Start With

### Bedrock Service Structure
```typescript
@Injectable()
export class BedrockAnalysisService {
  private bedrock: BedrockRuntimeClient;
  
  constructor() {
    this.bedrock = new BedrockRuntimeClient({
      region: process.env.AWS_REGION || 'us-east-1'
    });
  }
  
  async analyzeShoppingPatterns(purchases: Purchase[]): Promise<AIAnalysis> {
    // Implementation here
  }
}
```

## Testing Data Needed
- Sample customer with 20+ purchases
- Various product categories
- Different time intervals
- Seasonal variations

## Questions to Resolve
1. Bedrock model selection (Claude 3 Sonnet vs Haiku)?
2. Caching strategy for AI results?
3. Batch vs real-time analysis triggers?
4. Cost optimization approach?
