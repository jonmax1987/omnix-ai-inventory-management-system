# OMNIX AI - Production Testing Status

## Testing Overview
Comprehensive end-to-end production testing divided into independent test suites. Each test can be executed separately and results are tracked here for complete system validation.

**Production Environment:**
- Frontend: https://dh5a0lb9qett.cloudfront.net
- Backend API: https://18sz01wxsi.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/v1/
- AI Forecasting: https://18sz01wxsi.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/v1/ai/forecast
- AI Recommendations: https://18sz01wxsi.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/dev/v1/ai/recommendations

## Testing Execution Guidelines

### How to Use This System
1. **Choose any test suite** - Each is designed to be independent
2. **Start a new conversation** with: "Run [Test Suite Name] testing"
3. **Track progress** - Results will be updated in this file after each suite
4. **Flexible order** - Execute tests in any order that makes sense
5. **Parallel execution** - Multiple test suites can be run simultaneously

### Recommended Testing Strategies

**Quick Validation Path (60-90 minutes total):**
1. Core API Testing
2. Frontend Core Functionality  
3. Frontend-Backend Integration

**Comprehensive Validation Path (150-180 minutes total):**
1. All test suites in recommended dependency order
2. Full system validation before production launch

**Targeted Testing Path:**
- Choose specific areas based on concerns or changes
- Focus on high-risk or recently modified components
