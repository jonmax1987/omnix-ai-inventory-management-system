## Animation Implementation Guidelines

### Execution Strategy
1. **Start with Core Setup** - Essential foundation for all animations
2. **Choose any subsequent task** - All other tasks are independent once core is complete
3. **One task per conversation** - Focus on quality implementation
4. **Test thoroughly** - Verify performance and accessibility
5. **Update status** - Track progress in this document

### Performance Considerations
- **60fps target** - All animations should maintain smooth frame rates
- **Hardware acceleration** - Use transform and opacity properties when possible
- **Reduced motion** - Respect prefers-reduced-motion settings
- **Memory efficiency** - Clean up animations and avoid memory leaks
- **Bundle size** - Tree-shake unused Framer Motion features

### Accessibility Requirements
- **Reduced motion support** - Disable/reduce animations for sensitive users
- **Keyboard navigation** - Animations don't interfere with keyboard flow
- **Screen readers** - Animations don't disrupt assistive technology
- **Focus management** - Maintain proper focus during animated transitions

### Animation Principles
- **Easing curves** - Use natural, physics-based easing
- **Timing** - Appropriate duration for different interaction types
- **Hierarchy** - Important elements animate first
- **Continuity** - Smooth transitions maintain spatial relationships

### How to Start Animation Implementation:
```
User: "Implement [Animation Task Name]"
Assistant: 
1. Read animation_implementation_status.md
2. Check current status and dependencies
3. Implement the animation features
4. MANDATORY: Update task status in animation_implementation_status.md with:
   - Change status from "Not Started" to "Completed"
   - Add completion timestamp and implementation details
   - Note any performance metrics or accessibility considerations
   - Update overall progress percentage
5. Test performance and accessibility
```

### ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Progress Tracking Requirement
**EVERY completed animation task MUST update this document with:**
- ‚úÖ Status change: ‚ùå Not Started ‚Üí ‚úÖ Completed
- üìÖ Completion timestamp
- üìã Implementation summary (what was built)
- üéØ Performance notes (FPS, bundle size impact)
- ‚ôø Accessibility compliance verification
- üîó Files modified or created
