6. **Create repository**

### **Option 2: Use GitHub CLI (if installed)**

```bash
# Create repository directly from command line
gh repo create omnix-ai --public --description "🚀 AI-powered inventory management system"

# Or for private repository
gh repo create omnix-ai --private --description "🚀 AI-powered inventory management system"
```

## 🔗 Connect and Push

After creating the GitHub repository, run these commands:

```bash
# Add remote origin (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/omnix-ai.git

# Push all commits to GitHub
git push -u origin main

# Verify push was successful
git status
```

## 📋 Example Commands

```bash
# If your GitHub username is "johnsmith"
git remote add origin https://github.com/johnsmith/omnix-ai.git
git push -u origin main
```
