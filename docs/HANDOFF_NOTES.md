### Session Summary
- ✅ Designed comprehensive AI customer analytics system
- ✅ Created professional development workflow
- ✅ Set up context management structure
- ✅ Prepared all documentation for Phase 2 implementation

### Ready for Next Session
**Module**: Customer AI Analytics  
**Phase**: Phase 2 - AI Integration  
**Branch**: `feature/customer-ai-analytics` (to be created)

### Immediate Next Steps
1. **Create feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/customer-ai-analytics
   ```

2. **Install AWS Bedrock SDK**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install @aws-sdk/client-bedrock-runtime
   ```

3. **Create Bedrock service**
   - File: `/backend/src/services/bedrock.service.ts`
   - Follow template in `/context/customer-ai/NEXT_STEPS.md`

4. **Implement AI Lambda**
   - File: `/backend/src/lambda/ai-customer-analysis.ts`
