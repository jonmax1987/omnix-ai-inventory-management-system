## 2025-01-19: AI Service Selection - AWS Bedrock with Claude

**Decision**: Use AWS Bedrock with Claude 3 Sonnet for customer analysis

**Reasoning**:
- Already using AWS infrastructure (Lambda, DynamoDB)
- Claude provides excellent natural language understanding for purchase pattern analysis
- Bedrock provides managed infrastructure with no model hosting overhead
- Pay-per-use pricing model aligns with initial scale

**Alternatives Considered**:
- OpenAI GPT-4: More expensive, requires separate API management
- Self-hosted models: High infrastructure overhead, requires ML expertise
- AWS SageMaker: More complex setup, better for custom models

**Impact**:
- Simple integration with existing AWS services
- No infrastructure management required
- Cost-effective for initial implementation
- Can switch to SageMaker later if needed

## 2025-01-19: Data Architecture - Enhanced DynamoDB Tables

**Decision**: Create separate DynamoDB tables for AI-specific data

**Reasoning**:
- Separation of concerns between transactional and analytical data
- Independent scaling of AI workloads
- Easier to manage data retention policies
- Cleaner data model for AI processing

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Single table design: Would complicate queries and indexing
- PostgreSQL: Would require RDS setup and management
- MongoDB: Would introduce new technology stack

**Impact**:
- 4 new DynamoDB tables for customer AI data
- Clear separation between operational and analytical data
- Simplified backup and recovery strategies
- Independent scaling capabilities

## 2025-01-19: Development Workflow - Session-Based Context Management

**Decision**: Implement structured session-based development with comprehensive documentation

**Reasoning**:
- Prevents context loss between Claude conversations
- Ensures professional development practices
- Maintains clear progress tracking
- Enables smooth handoffs

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Ad-hoc development: Risk of context loss and inconsistency
- Single long conversation: Token limits and performance degradation
- External project management tools: Additional overhead

**Impact**:
- Structured documentation in /docs and /context folders
- 45-60 minute focused development sessions
- Clear handoff protocols
- Comprehensive progress tracking

## 2025-01-19: Customer Privacy Approach - Privacy-First Design

**Decision**: Implement privacy-by-design with explicit consent management

**Reasoning**:
- GDPR/CCPA compliance requirements
- Build customer trust through transparency
- Avoid future legal complications
- Industry best practice

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Minimal compliance: Risk of regulatory issues
- Opt-out model: Less customer-friendly
- No personalization: Would defeat system purpose

**Impact**:
- Consent management system required
- Data anonymization for AI training
- Clear data retention policies
- Transparent privacy communications

---

## 2025-01-19: AI Analysis Frequency - Hybrid Batch/Real-time

**Decision**: Daily batch analysis with real-time updates for active sessions

**Reasoning**:
- Balance between cost and freshness
- Most consumption patterns don't change hourly
- Real-time for active shopping provides immediate value
- Batch processing is more cost-effective

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Pure real-time: Too expensive for all customers
- Weekly batch: Data would be too stale
- On-demand only: Would miss proactive opportunities

**Impact**:
- Daily batch Lambda runs at 2 AM
- Real-time endpoints for active customers
- Caching strategy required
- Cost optimization through batching
