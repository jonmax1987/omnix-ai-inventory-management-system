### 🌐 Current Deployment:
- **Local Server**: http://localhost:8082
- **Status**: ✅ Running 
- **Build Type**: Static export (production optimized)
- **Size**: ~99.7 kB initial bundle

### 📱 Available Pages:
1. **Dashboard** (`/dashboard/`) - Fade transitions, inventory overview
2. **Inventory** (`/inventory/`) - Slide left transitions, product management
3. **Forecasts** (`/forecasts/`) - Slide up transitions, AI predictions
4. **Transition Test** (`/transition-test/`) - Interactive animation demo
5. **Animation Test** (`/animation-test/`) - Complete animation showcase

## 🛠 Deployment Script Usage

Use the custom deployment script `./deploy.sh`:

### Local Deployment
```bash
# Deploy locally (recommended for testing)
./deploy.sh -t local -p 8080

# Deploy without rebuilding
./deploy.sh -t local -p 8080 --no-build

# Build only (no deployment)
./deploy.sh --build-only
```

### Cloud Deployment Options

#### 1. Vercel (Recommended for Next.js)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm i -g vercel

# Deploy to Vercel
./deploy.sh -t vercel
```

#### 2. Netlify
```bash
# Install Netlify CLI
npm i -g netlify-cli

# Deploy to Netlify
./deploy.sh -t netlify
```

#### 3. AWS S3 + CloudFront
```bash
# Configure AWS CLI first
aws configure

# Deploy to AWS (requires additional setup)
./deploy.sh -t aws-s3
```

#### 4. Manual Static Hosting
The `out/` directory contains all static files that can be uploaded to any web server:
- Upload contents of `out/` folder to your web server
- Ensure server supports HTML5 routing (for client-side routing)

### Key Features:
- **Static Export**: Pre-rendered HTML files for optimal performance
- **Code Splitting**: Automatic chunk splitting for faster loading
- **Font Optimization**: Preloaded fonts for better CLS scores
- **CSS Optimization**: Styled-components with build-time optimization
- **Image Optimization**: Configured for static export compatibility

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create `.env.production` for production-specific settings:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=https://your-api.example.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_ASSET_PREFIX=https://your-cdn.example.com
```

### Server Requirements
- **Static File Server**: Any server that can serve static files (Apache, Nginx, etc.)
- **HTML5 Routing**: Server should support fallback to index.html for client-side routing
- **HTTPS**: Recommended for production deployments

## ✨ Post-Deployment Testing

### Manual Testing Checklist:
1. **Homepage Redirect**: `/` should redirect to `/dashboard/`
2. **Navigation**: All sidebar links should work with smooth transitions
3. **Animations**: 
   - Page transitions between routes
   - Loading bar appears during navigation
   - Button hover effects work
   - Accessibility controls in animation test page
4. **Responsive Design**: Test on mobile, tablet, and desktop
5. **Performance**: Check loading speeds and animation smoothness

### Automated Testing:
```bash
# Run accessibility tests
npm run test:a11y

# Run all tests
npm test

# Check type safety
npm run type-check

# Lint code
npm run lint
```

## 📊 Performance Optimization

### Already Implemented:
- ✅ Static generation for better SEO and performance
- ✅ Automatic code splitting
- ✅ Font preloading
- ✅ CSS-in-JS build-time optimization
- ✅ Reduced motion support for accessibility
- ✅ Framer Motion optimized for 60fps animations

### Monitoring:
- Use browser dev tools to monitor Core Web Vitals
- Test animation performance on lower-end devices
- Monitor bundle size in production

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:
1. **Internal Server Error**: Clear build cache with `rm -rf .next out` and rebuild
2. **Port Already in Use**: Use different port with `-p` option
3. **Animation Not Working**: Check that JavaScript is enabled and Framer Motion loaded
4. **Routing Issues**: Ensure server supports HTML5 routing

### Debug Mode:
```bash
# Enable debug mode
NEXT_DEBUG=1 npm run build

# Check bundle analysis
npm run build -- --analyze
```
